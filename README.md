This package is a collection of simple R functions that I’ve either
written or discovered over the years that I’ve found useful and like to
re-use. In some cases, these functions are just thin wrappers around
other functions but the syntax is easier for me to remember.

This is a work in progress.

To install, you need to have the devtools package on your system (if you
don’t have it, install that with install.packages(“devtools”) ) and then
run

``` r
devtools::install_github("smach/rmiscutils")
```

Some of the tasks that functions in this package accomplish:

Add a row to a dataframe with the format

``` r
 add_row(mydf, col1 = 4, col2 = 7, col3="A")
```

`add_row`

Add a row to a dataframe with the format

``` r
add_row_from_list(iris, list(5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2, "setosa"))
```

`add_row_from_list`

Calculate percentages from selected data frame columns by row, and add
new columns with that data. Designed for election results.
`add_pct_cols_to_dataframe`

Calculate the statistical mode of a vector (which base R oddly does not
do). `mymode`

Capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string. (Note: base R
3.2.0 subsequently included the `tools::toTitleCase(`) function, but
toinitialcap has the advantage of naming consistency with base R’s
`tolower` and `toupper`). `toinitialcap` – to go along with base R’s
tolower() and toupper(),

Convert all NA values in a data frame to zeroes. `na2zero`

Convert only NA values to zeroes in data frame columns that are numeric
or integers. Uses for loops, so may be slow for large data frames.
`na2zero2`

Convert character strings containing numbers with commas into numbers.
`numbers_with_commas`

Convert a vector of character strings into an ordered factor, keeping
the original order. Helpful if x-axis order is important when
visualizing data. (Created before the forcats package).
`strings_to_ordered_factors`

Create a frequency table sorted by descending frequency. (Would probably
use a version of `janitor::tabyl` today) `table_sorted`

Find winning candidates in a spreadsheet or data frame of election
results. `elec_find_winner`

Find winning (or other) streaks in a vector of data. This is a slightly
modified function from [Exploring Baseball Data with
R](https://baseballwithr.wordpress.com/2014/07/07/team-streaks-part-i-2/).
`streaks`

Open the file that allows you to edit the RStudio dropdown list of
projects. `edit_project_list()`

Read a text file into an R variable as a single character string.
`read_textfile`

Rename a single data frame column using format
`renamecol(mydf, oldcolname, newcolname)` `renamecol`

Remove columns from a data frame where *all* values are NA. Useful when
importing spreadsheets or CSV files where there are some empty columns.
`removecolsAllNA`

Unload a package from current working session. Because it can be
difficult to remember that
`detach("package:mypackagename", unload=TRUE)` or
`unloadNamespace("mypackagename")` are the opposites of
`library("mypackagename")`. `unlibrary`

Write an object containing character string data to a text file.
`write_textfile`

From a character string, return the value of an object with that name
(there’s also string2varname, which does the reverse) `varname2string`

Some of the package’s functions by function name:
-------------------------------------------------

*add\_pct\_cols\_to\_dataframe* – designed for election results, will
calculate percentages from selected columns by row and add new columns
with that data.

*add\_row* – add a row to a dataframe with the format

``` r
 add_row(mydf, col1 = 4, col2 = 7, col3="A")
```

Thanks to Hadely Wickham for that function idea.

*add\_row\_from\_list* – add a row to a dataframe with the format

``` r
add_row_from_list(iris, list(5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2, "setosa"))
```

Thanks to Jennifer Bryan for that function idea.

*edit\_project\_list* – opens the file that controls RStudio’s dropdown
project list.

*mymode* – calculates the statistical mode of a vector, which base R
oddly does not do.

*na2zero* – turn all NA values in a data frame to zeroes.

*na2zero2* – turns only NA values to zeroes in data frame columns that
are numeric or integers. Uses for loops, so may be slow for large data
frames.

*number\_with\_commas* – easily turn character strings containing
numbers with commas into numbers.

*read\_textfile* – read a text file into an R variable as a single
character string.

*renamecol* – rename a single column in a dataframe using format
renamecol(mydf, oldcolname, newcolname)

*removecolsAllNA* – remove columns from a data frame where *all* values
are NA. Useful when importing spreadsheets or CSV files where there are
some empty columns.

*toinitialcap* – to go along with base R’s tolower() and toupper(),
capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string. Note: base R
3.2.0 now has tools::toTitleCase() function.

*streaks* – find winning (or other) streaks in a vector of data,
slightly modified function from [Exploring Baseball Data with
R](https://baseballwithr.wordpress.com/2014/07/07/team-streaks-part-i-2/).

*strings\_to\_ordered\_factors* – turn a vector of character strings
into an ordered factor, keeping the original order. Helpful if x-axis
order is important when visualizing data.

*table\_sorted* – get frequency table sorted by frequency descending.

*unlibrary* – because it can be difficult to remember that
detach(“package:mypackagename”, unload=TRUE) or
unloadNamespace(“mypackagename”) are the opposites of
library(“mypackagename”).

*varname2string* – takes string and returns value of an object with that
name (there’s also string2varname, which does the reverse)

*write\_textfile* – write an object containing character string data to
a text file.
